Code Camp Demonstration app
Hybrid MVC / AngularJS mini-SPA app using TypeScript

A) - Set up initial structure of application MVC5NgTsDemo

	Used BGoodMusic.Models from MVC5NgDemo.

	in anticipation of AngularJS code to be added.

	http://type.litesolutions.net/
	(problems with tt file)

	Some success with console app like
	http://blog.simonlovely.com/archive/2014/11/09/using-typelite-to-generate-typescript.aspx

	Moved API\Rehearsal from web app to separate Models assembly to get console app to work.

	(Need to figure out how to better deal with date type conversion)
