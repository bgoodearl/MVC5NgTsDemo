Code Camp Demonstration app
Hybrid MVC / AngularJS mini-SPA app using TypeScript

A) - Set up initial structure of application MVC5NgTsDemo

	Used BGoodMusic.Models from MVC5NgDemo.
	Created fake repository in BGoodMusic.EFDAL so demo can be run without database.
	Tweaked packages - removing some to simplify, updating others, adding new packages
	in anticipation of AngularJS code to be added.

B) - Added initial web service for Rehearsals

C) - Added initial structure for Angular app

	Added module typescript files - app.module.ts, etc.
	Added code to BundleConfig to bundle app js files.
	Added _LayoutNg 
	Added Music MVC controller with App method and App view.

D) - Experiment with interface generation using TypeLITE

	http://type.litesolutions.net/
	(problems with tt file)

	Some success with console app like
	http://blog.simonlovely.com/archive/2014/11/09/using-typelite-to-generate-typescript.aspx

	Moved API\Rehearsal from web app to separate Models assembly to get console app to work.

	Generated bgoodmusic.d.ts, modified by hand to change number to Date for "date" property.
	(Need to figure out how to better deal with date type conversion)
