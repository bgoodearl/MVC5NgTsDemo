Code Camp Demonstration app
Hybrid MVC / AngularJS mini-SPA app using TypeScript

A) - Set up initial structure of application MVC5NgTsDemo

	Used BGoodMusic.Models from MVC5NgDemo.
	Created fake repository in BGoodMusic.EFDAL so demo can be run without database.
	Tweaked packages - removing some to simplify, updating others, adding new packages
	in anticipation of AngularJS code to be added.

B) - Added initial web service for Rehearsals
